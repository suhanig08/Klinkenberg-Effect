# Klinkenberg Effect â€“ Gas Permeability Analysis

This project demonstrates the analysis of gas permeability in porous media using the **Klinkenberg effect**. It includes:

âœ… Linear regression to determine absolute permeability and slip factor  
âœ… Newton-Raphson method with empirical slip factor to estimate permeability  
âœ… Side-by-side comparison of predicted and actual permeability  
âœ… Clear plots and summary tables  
âœ… Beginner-friendly, well-commented code

## ðŸ“Š Inputs

- Lab data: Measured gas permeability `k_g` and mean pressure `p_m`
- Data can be hardcoded or read from a `.csv`

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Outputs

- Linear regression plot of `k_g` vs `1/p_m`
- Comparison plot of measured vs predicted `k_g`
- Newton-Raphson iteration results
- Summary table with all computed values
